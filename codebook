The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
  wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity 
   at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets
  , where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

This code book  describes the variables used in the R script file.

1.fullDate is made up of two seperate datasets, the Testdata and the Traindata.

2.featureN denotes the number of all columns provided which is used to excluded unneeded columns from the fullData, getting the finalData

3.the column names:
    starts with t : time
    starts with f : frequency
    -mean         : Mean
    -std          : Standard deviation
