getting and cleaning data week3

this R.scipt file can be divided into three parts

Firstly, it can load all the train and test data into R then put them in good shape, excluding the useless columns (in this case, after merging the tables , only keep the columns whose names are relevant to mean or standard deviation ).

Secondly, After it get the dataset which we called the finalData, then it can adjust the column nameas and the forms, by renaming several columns in order to make an understandable dataset.

Finally, the R file can group the data stored in this dataset and by the labels attached to each column previously. Then it writed the dataset into Txt through the work directory.
